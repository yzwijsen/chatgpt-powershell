It serves as an example on how to use the chatGPT api with powershell

## Requirements

- PowerShell
- An API key for OpenAI's API

1. Replace `<your API key>` in the script with your OpenAI API key.
2. Save the script as `ChatGPT-Powershell.ps1` or a name of your choice.

## Usage

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the folder containing the script.
2. Execute the script: `.\ChatGPT-Powershell.ps1`
3. You'll see a welcome message and a prompt to enter your question or command.
4. Type your question or command and press Enter.
5. The AI will respond with its output.
6. To exit the script, type `exit` and press Enter.

# ChatGPT Powershell #
######################
Enter your prompt to continue. (type 'exit' to quit or 'reset' to start a new chat)

You: What is the capital of France?

## Notes

- The script initializes the AI with a default system message: "You are a helpful assistant".
- You can change this message to set a different context for the AI by modifying the `$AiSystemMessage` variable.
- The script will keep track of the conversation history, so the AI can provide context-aware answers.
