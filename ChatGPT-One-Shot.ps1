This script will take a rough email draft and help you turn it into a professionally written email.
It's a minimal example showing how to set a system message in order to elicit a one-shot response from ChatGPT.

# Define API key and endpoint
$ApiKey = "<your API key>"
$ApiEndpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

System message.
You can use this to give the AI instructions on what to do, how to act or how to respond to future prompts.
Default value for ChatGPT = "You are a helpful assistant."

$AiSystemMessage = "You are an email writing assistant. I will provide you with a rough draft of an email or some general message that I want to convey and you will respond with a clean, professionally writen email. Please provide 3 seperate answers ranging from informal, formal to business formal. All answers must be in the same language as the provided input."
